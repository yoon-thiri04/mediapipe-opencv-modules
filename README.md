This repository contains Python modules for **hand tracking**, **pose estimation**, **face detection**, and **face mesh** using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It is designed to be easy to use and integrate into your own projects.  

## Features
- **Hand Tracking** – Detect and track hands in real-time.  
- **Pose Estimation** – Estimate human body pose keypoints.  
- **Face Detection** – Detect faces in images and video streams.  
- **Face Mesh** – Detect and draw detailed face landmarks.  

## Included Files
- `modules/` – Python modules for each functionality.  
- Sample videos in `/videos/`– For testing each module’s functionality.
  
## Notes

* **Python version:** Python 3.10 is required as MediaPipe only supports this version.
* Make sure your webcam or input video works with OpenCV.
* Adjust module settings in the scripts as needed for your application.
